# Chapter 1

The snow began to fall quite quickly as Mrs. Thordil dragged her two whining children back home. While nearing the age of 40, Mrs. Thordil still kept her sarcasm, wit, and a healthy amount of glamor. Regardless of the fact that she was almost always drenched in some sort of mud and caked in many variants of soil, she was still a pretty sight to see. Her red hair, although tucked tightly into a bun and hidden in a woolly cap, still managed to escape here and there as if gasping for air. And along with her beauty, it seemed Mrs. Thordil also failed to lose her strength, easily grasping a child in each hand and dragging them back. Their feet began to draw lines in the snow, marking a clear path of movement. Mrs. Thordil, herself, became well aware of the weather, grumbling to herself and moving faster. The snow never brought good tidings.  

She dragged her children all the way to her small home. A cuboid thatch hut with a small brick circle and a fire raging inside. The mud floor started to become more and more wet with each snowflake that cascaded upon it. She grimaced. She would have to go out tomorrow in the freezing cold to check on her crops and make sure that at least the potatoes survived, otherwise she would have to take out another loan. She openly groaned at the thought, all while placing the kids in the far corner of the house and wrapping them in a patched thin red blanket. The banker would surely never give her another loan. She would starve and so would her children.

Horrified at the idea, she turned and barked towards her oldest child. “Marius, stay in the house. I need to check on the crops and if I catch a single sign that you left, I’ll thrash you till you no longer have a backside. Do I make myself clear?” Marius, annoyed at his confinement, sighed with immeasurable and resigned disappointment. “Yes, mum”, he breathed. 

Mrs. Thordil dragged her heavy and waterlogged boots back outside. The cold began to reach her toes as she quickly breathed in air with clenched teeth. She winced from the immediate cold, as the snow began to rest on the top of her nose. Her usually redder lips became more and more pink with each step despite how tightly she held her large brown overcoat.

“I look like a dome,” she whispered. Her breath danced in front of her in the form of a transparent cloud. “A solid dome with a head. I’m a fucking nipple.”

“Oh! Ms. Thordil! Is that you? I almost failed to recognize you. Your overcoat made me fear you became a bear.” A higher and anger-inducing voice squeaked from behind her on the left side. “I wish you didn’t fucking recognize me,” Mrs. Thordil grumbled quietly. She turned around to see the dainty figure of Myra Stumpf, a noblewoman who was most definitely aware of her nobility. A deep maroon coat lightly covered her dark red vest. Her thin waist and small figure floated closer towards Mrs. Thordil.

“Myra! It is always a pleasure to see you”, Mrs. Thordil recited. “My my, the snow only complements your visage.”

“Oh please, stop your flattery, Ms. Thordil. It is completely ineffective in my presence.” Clearly, the flattery was working. “May I ask,” Myra continued, “what are you doing out in the snow?”

Mrs. Thordil grimaced. “It’s Mrs. Thordil, and it will always stay that way.”

“But your husband-” Myra interrupted.

“Is alive in my heart”, Mrs. Thordil concluded. A small and almost invisible smile appeared on Mrs. Thordil’s lips as Myra slightly recoiled from the venom in Mrs. Thordil’s retort. Mrs. Thordil won this conversation. “I need to check on my crops, dear.”

Myra frowned. Mrs. Thordil saw this. The battle was already in her favor and now she intended to rub it in Myra’s face.

Myra returned her face back to normal. Then a sly smile encroached her lips. Mrs. Thordil frowned. The tables were turning.

“Oh you poor thing. I suppose it must be incredibly difficult without a husband to tend your crops.” Myra put a sad smile on her face, but her eyes shone with the light of victory. The battle was turning in her favor, and she would capitalize on it.

Mrs. Thordil was taken aback. Myra dealt a vicious blow and she realized that if she failed to reply, Myra would win. That could not happen. That will never happen.

“As sad as it may be,” Mrs. Thordil began, “at least I can pride myself on being truly independent and not dine on the wealth and power of my late husband, like a gold-drinking succubus.” Mrs. Thordil put out a strong start and she managed to keep the battle at bay. But she needed to conclude the war, otherwise, the field was open to be sieged again.

“Oh and before I forget,” Mrs. Thordil waved her hand as she began to walk away, “do pass on my greetings to your husband, the venerable and wealthy Craven Stumpf.” And to announce her victory, she turned back around to face Myra. “Take care of yourself, puppet. Try not to catch a cold.” With that, she left. She could feel Myra’s irritation and drive to continue the fight, but Mrs. Thordil had already gone too far. “A tactical retreat,” she thought to herself. She had won.

As Mrs. Thordil made her way to the fields, she was welcomed by Artur Morena. The big lumbering giant of a few words nodded his head in her direction.

“Hello Artur!”

“Hello,” he boomed. “Here to check on your crops?”

“Yes,” she breathed. The cold was making it harder to breathe. Noticing her labored breath, Artur brushed the snow off her coat and laid his on top of hers.

“Oh now that wasn’t necessary, Artur.” Mrs. Thordil was actually quite pleased and loved the warm embrace of the new heavy jacket. “I just need to check if my crops are doing well. The snow is a fucking menace.”

“And the elves too. There might be a war breaking out.” Artur shifted as if the topic made him nervous.

“Elves?! Shit.” Mrs. Thordil concluded. She just could never catch a break. First the snow, then the elves, and now a war.

“I’ve also been instructed to tell you ma’am to keep your children away from the witch in the woods.” Artur spouted with the utmost sincerity. He seemed genuinely afraid.

“Oh don’t bother about it, Artur,” Mrs. Thordil calmed him down, “It’s probably the fucking elves. But, regardless, I will make sure they go nowhere near the woods.”

She peered around him to make sure her crops were well tended to. She just managed to peer through her half-frozen eyes and saw that her crops were covered by several sheets of dried animal hide and held above her plants by wooden planks at the four corners of her plot. She heaved a sigh of relief, and rubbed her hands together to keep them warm.

“What of the Baron, Artur?” Mrs. Thordil continued, “How is Lord Shithead, his majesty and grace, doing?”

“The Baron isn’t too happy either.” Artur said with a chuckle. “He’s not looking too good.”

“I will be absolutely honest with you, Artur,” Mrs. Thordil replied, “I have not two shits to give about the rich bastard’s health. I can assure you, his health-however horrifying it may be-is far better than we are.”

Artur let out a roaring guffaw as he leaned back and clutched his ribs, almost as if to keep them from running away. Mrs. Thordil smiled. She liked making Artur laugh. It was easy.

"What a shit life, Artur."

“Don’t worry about your crops. I checked them. They’re covered up now.” Artur stood an inch taller, puffing out his chest and standing stiff as a statue.

“Oh, thank you so much, Artur.” Mrs. Thordil stood on her toes and leaned forward. She placed a gentle kiss on Artur’s cheek as red infiltrated the tan complexion of Artur’s face. She could see Artur’s heart flutter a little. Mrs. Thordil chuckled. “Thank you Artur, and take care of yourself. The snow seems to be coming in quite thick.” Mrs. Thordil took off Artur’s coat and returned it back to him.

“I will. Get home safe!” Artur thundered.

Mrs. Thordil waved back and made her way home, trudging her feet in the wet snow. Then she heard him.

The whinny of a horse quickly gathered her attention. Horses were rare in Brugundia, and the sight of one always made people uncomfortable. Then she saw him. A tall brown horse with a dark black mane sauntered in carefully. On top of the horse rested a man. He wore a tan, light brown buttoned shirt-piece that seemed very worn and slightly torn in several places. The sleeves were folded back revealing strong forearms. His white hair was long, going down to his lower neck, and some of the hair was tied back in a knot in the back of his head with the other hair hanging down. Above his light brown shirt, he wore a reddish-brown vest with a brown leather belt separating the torso and his equally reddish brown pants. A dark broad brimmed hat rested on his head and a long iron sword was strapped to his back, another silver sword rested in his hands, gripped firmly. The sword, which once cleared donned a bright complexion was spattered with red puddles of blood, either drying or dripping to the edge of the blade.

Mrs. Thordil was stunned. What brought her out of her frozen state was confusion. Why did the man look young despite the fact that he had white hair?

The horse stopped in front of her, and the man looked at her, his expression terrifyingly neutral. 

“I heard there’s a job here. Somethin’ about a son being missing?” he wondered aloud. 

Mrs. Thordil was, once again, caught off guard by his accent. It seemed out of place. Regardless, not wanting to irritate the dangerous person with two different swords, she pointed in the direction of the Baron’s estate.

“Thank you, ma'am,” the man grunted. He tipped his hat and smiled. A comforting and warm smile that somehow made Mrs. Thordil blush but also made her shiver on the inside. With that he rode off in the direction she pointed as Mrs. Thordil just stood there, dumbfounded. As the man rode on forward, even others paused their daily tasks to gawk at the stranger on a horse. Who was that man? What was that man?
