# Chapter 2

With a roaring cough and undulating blood in his mouth, he awoke, spitting the blood in a beautiful jewel-encrusted bowl residing by his bedside. The bowl, laced with rubies, sapphires, and diamonds all carved with the greatest care and most gentle craftsmanship that money could buy, stood ready for the horrendous mixture of vomit and blood that leaked from its owner's mouth. As much as he tried though, he could not keep his satin blankets from being decorated in small droplets of his blood. He breathed a sigh filled with years of regret and an existential feeling for the future to come and resumed vomiting blood into his chalice.

“Your Lordship!” A shrill voice raced down the hallway, as the source trailed behind. Finally, a well dressed younger man arrived with great speed, leaning against a wall for support as he momentarily regained the air he lost. “Are you feeling ill again, sire?”

“Ill? No. I’m merely coughing up my fucking insides for my own pleasure.” The baron sat in his bed, his bony hands resting on his swirling stomach. He figured he would wait until the smallest flicker of torchlight went off in his servant’s head.

It seemed, however, that the baron was out of luck; the servant just stared with an expression so blank that his face could have transformed into an inky void of infinite nothingness and it would have conveyed the exact same emotion as his current expression.

“I AM DYING, YOU WORTHLESS FOOL!” screamed the baron. His throat seized immediately as he fell into a coughing fit. The servant, upon seeing the squirming pale skeleton that was his master, exited the room with intense haste, shouting for the herbalist.

The baron’s head throbbed. It rolled and roiled in the waves of pain that crashed and whipped against the insides of his skull. After a moment of wincing, the baron began to follow the instructions of the herbalist. He muttered to himself, “I am Baron Dieter Runehart. I am the baron of Brugundia. The fields, hills, rivers, and mine in this town belong to me. I am Baron Dieter Runehart.” A pause rang loudly both in the royal bed chambers and in the baron’s mind. “I am alone,” he finished.

Several hours of constant attention and questioning tortured the baron. Questions of his diet, his daily activities, his sexual activities, any activities at all flooded the baron until he was drowning endlessly in servants and scents of burning rosemary. It was not until the baron threatened to kill the herbalist and then himself that the questions ceased. Relief washed over the baron. Finally, he managed to escort the herbalist out of his bedchambers and proceeded to dress himself for his duties. Slipping into his robes was not as difficult as it once was. Although the baron was dying constantly, he came to the realization that it was much easier to don any type of clothing without feeling restricted. “If I am to die,” he thought to himself, “at least I will die in comfortable clothing.”

After straining himself for a considerable amount of time for the sake of presentation, the baron staggered his way to the throne room to attend to his people, the mere thought of it making him shudder in agony. Slowly and painfully, he managed to take his place on the throne. A sigh fell out of the baron’s mouth, followed by several gasps and heaves. Soon after, a moment of quiet descended upon the empty throne room. This was-without question-the baron’s favorite time of day: the time right before people entered his castle, when all was quiet and dark, when he could be sad, happy, or scared without the fear of prying eyes. This was peace-

BLAAAAAAAAAAT

The cacophony of trumpets thundered in his ears as the baron-out of habit-forced himself to sit a bit straighter. If he was to die horribly, at least no one would notice.

Ministers flooded into the Royal Hall like snakes slithering towards a fallen prey. A prey that was too weak and too tired to run and defend itself. The baron knew beyond all doubt that the ministers and nobles knew every intimate detail of his condition. It was in their best interest to know all about him, not for any concern of his personal wellbeing or safety, but because these details gave them a timetable for their own succession. Since the baron had no heir of his own to call upon to take his crown, the title will have to fall to one of the ministers that the baron chooses. Due to this, the baron went from losing his mother and father at an early age, to now being surrounded by about five or six different “mothers”, all of whom dote upon him constantly, but none of whom care about him.

One of the “mothers”, a tall wry fellow with regal robes stands upright, towering over his peers as he stares at the baron. The baron envies his posture and grimaces as the standing minister licks his dry lips slowly, as if to salivate at the sight of the baron’s sickly visage. The minister cleared his throat and spoke hungrily, “Sire, there are reports that might pique your interest. These reports come from some of our soldiers sent into the marshes, and almost all of them agree with one another. There definitely is a cottage in the Southern Woodlands. It is not too far from here-one must cross the Chitrasha River-but a day’s march shall cover it. Our army, albeit somewhat ill-equipped for facing the enemy, can be dispatched today. And if dispatched with great haste, I can conclude with a great deal of certainty that they will recover the child-”

“Enemy..?”, the baron croaked. “Such a drastic sense of diction.”

“Sire? I-”

“We are not going to war, Vira. We are finding my son. That ‘enemy’ you just referenced with disgust happens to be his guardian.”

The minister took a slight step back. The baron stared relentlessly. The minster broke eye contact to peek at his cohorts. The baron smiled.

“You will treat them with respect,” continued the baron, taking advantage of the brief stumble from his opponent, “The army shall not march today. I have, instead, acquired the attention of a very capable hunter. He will complete the task.”

The ministers scowled at the mention of hunters. Understandably, thought the baron. Hunters have had a history of eliminating ministers, magistrates, and even kings for a fair price. Having a hunter is akin to having an unsheathed sword tucked into one’s trousers and proceeding to go hop, skip, and jump in the fields. Vira did not scowl, though. He nodded. More worryingly, he nodded with acceptance. The baron gritted his teeth.

“He is to receive no resistance from any of you and shall answer directly and solely to me!” The baron quickly scanned the room to sense any differing opinions. Reliably, all of the ministers seemed frustrated, concerned, and rejected. All except for Vira. The baron began to slightly sweat. He grew more impatient. He needed Vira to show some emotion, to show some sign of weakness. Otherwise, the baron would just be striking at a wooden target, only tiring himself out. He grabbed at the armrests. He pulled himself forward. He straightened his back with clenched teeth. He stared daggers at Vira. He roared.

“HE SHALL-”

The door opened with a deafening creak and the rhythmic battering of metal nails and hinges.

The baron saw Vira turn to face the door out of the corner of his eye. He sighed and cursed under his breath. Had the door not opened, the baron would have definitely lost control of the court. Vira, in his stoned gaze would have commanded the attention and the tide would have turned against him.

The baron stared at the door with a look of gratitude, only to be greeted by the sight of a horrid creature: A nightmare that walks on two legs and wields two swords. He saw the hunter and took a deep shaky breath.
