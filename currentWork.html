    <p class="featured__description">This is a Virtual Reality Remake of a previous project that I 
      made many years ago. The idea is to make a <strong>VR Action Roguelike</strong> that is set in a tavern. 
      The player will be able to defend their tavern from a horde of monsters that are trying to break in.
      The player will be able to use <strong>various weapons</strong> as well as <strong>employ a host of NPCs</strong> to help them in their
      quest.
    </p>
    <p class="featured__description">The idea is to create a VR Game that has a great amount of replayability as well
      as standing up to the quality of other non-VR roguelikes. The game will be released on the <strong>Oculus Quest 2</strong> and <strong>PCVR</strong>.
