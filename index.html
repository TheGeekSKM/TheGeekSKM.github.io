								<h2 class="major" style="font-family: VCR OSD Mono">Who am I?</h2>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">I'm a Texas based Video Game Programmer and Designer that specializes in programming, mechanic  design, as well as more creative elements such as narrative design.</p>
								
								<h2 class="major" style="font-family: VCR OSD Mono">What do I do?</h2>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">While I am well versed in the field of design, I personally prefer the programming/scripting aspect of game development. I love the chaos of creating complex NPC and 
									Enemy AI as well as the functionality of a good Character Controller System. That being said, I do love dabbling in other fields of scripting as well, like tools development, engine programming, etc.</p>
								
								<h2 class="major" style="font-family: VCR OSD Mono">Favorite Game of All Time</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/witcher.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"> Few games have truly captured the experience of Role Playing as The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. The massive open-world RPG quickly became known as one of the 
									greatest games ever made, boasting a 92% on Metacritic and 9.3/10 on IGN. While many of these sites simply claim that the game is good, very few actually detail why.</p>

									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">At first, the average player might believe that it is the mechanical aspect of the game that makes it so widely appreciated. However, this is untrue. Mechanically speaking, the Witcher 3 
									is no marvel. Oftentimes, the combat can feel either too exhaustive and complicated or too simple. Many enemies can simply be killed by the well revered “slash-and-barrel-roll-away”. 
									In my playthrough, I barely had any good armor or weapons and simply dodged away to win. Even the animation is not perfect, with a variety of bugs present throughout. 
									On top of that, the character models are often reused at various places, making it seem that a good chunk of the population is the same person wearing different clothes and speaking with different voices. 
									Upon further inspection, the mechanics of Witcher 3-aside from the greatest minigame of all time: Gwent-are nothing to be awestruck by. 
									Instead, the true beauty of The Witcher 3 comes from the stories it tells. </p>
									
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Originally based on the Witcher series of books by Andrej Sapkowski, the Witcher games sought to continue the storytelling methods 
									of their source material by sticking to the concept of “realism in fantasy”. In his books Sapkowski uses fantasy elements like vampires, monsters, fairies, and fictional lands to tell very real stories. 
									The books commonly told stories of love, loss, hardship, and betrayal, thereby exploring the concept of "morally grey". 
									In the books, Geralt-our protagonist-was not a hero, but a simple creature trying to find peace and joy, leading him to make some unethical decisions in the name of achieving peace.
									The game took this concept and ran with it, creating a masterpiece of a game that challenges almost every common belief.</p> 
									
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">The Witcher 3 tells difficult stories, like the story of an abusive and alcoholic 
									father, whose wife and child ran away from him, and who wants nothing more than to be forgiven and to prove that he has changed. 
									The story of the Bloody Baron (the story I mentioned earlier) is heralded as one of the best stories ever told in video games, because we see that there is no one in the story that is truly evil. 
									While the baron’s wife and daughter were completely justified with running away, we empathize with the baron and his quest to seek redemption. 
									This and many other stories that fill the main quests and even the small side quests are what make The Witcher 3 the masterpiece that it is.</p>
								   
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">By teaching us empathy, the Witcher 3 makes the most fantastical elements of its story feel honest, real, and, most importantly, human.</p>

								<h2>1: <a href="https://thegeekskm.itch.io/aopsod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >The Arena of Providence and The Sandwich of Destiny</a></h2>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://thegeekskm.itch.io/aopsod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><img src="images/MountyLymp.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">This was the second Virtual Reality game that I developed with a partner <a href="https://github.com/nicolasmaclean">(Nick Maclean)</a>. 
									This game allowed me to mess with VR Combat, especially with Melee Combat. 
									I was able to create a Melee Combat Template that is quite robust with little setup required.</p>
								
								<h2>2: <a href="https://thegeekskm.itch.io/lonelypingpng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >The Loneliest Game of Pong of All Time</a></h2>
								<span class="image main"> <a href="https://thegeekskm.itch.io/lonelypingpng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><img src="images/LonelyPong.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"><i>"The only game where you spend the entire game playing with yourself, by yourself. 
									Bask in your utter loneliness and solitude with this game of ping pong."</i> - Me</p> 
								<p>This was my first foray into Virtual Reality Games and it was a wonderful experience.</p>

								<h1 class="major">Games for UTD</h1>

								<h2>1: <a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GhostHouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Ghost House</a></h2>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GhostHouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><img src="images/ghosthouse.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"> This was the first game that I developed for The University of Texas at Dallas Game Production 
									Course. I worked with a team of developers and was mainly in charge of developing a Custom Event System that did not live in scene
									but actually lived in the project files, allowing assets to communicate with assets in other scenes without being active in the game. 
									On top of that, I was tasked with creating the Player Movement System which allowed for both keyboard movement in an isometric game, but also
									a mouse-based dragging movement system that also worked with isometric views.
								</p>

								<h2>2: <a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GameLab_ToborQuest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Tobor Quest</a></h2>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GameLab_ToborQuest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><img src="images/toborquest.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"> This is the second game that I developed for UT Dallas. ToborQuest is a time trial racing game where the goal is to
									deliver food from the start of the level to the end of the level. For this project I was mostly in charge of backend systems designing/programming. Most
									of my work was not in the visual department. I created the fracture system that would cause objects to shatter upon a certain amount of force being exerted on them.
									I also created a dialogue system that allowed for skipping of dialogue, editor tools for creating dialogue that were very designer friendly, and dialogue box animations
									with a tweening library.
								</p>

								<h2>2: <a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GameLab_S23Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Death Bloom: Arveado’s Final Chapter</a></h2>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/metalac190/GameLab_S23Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><img src="images/deathbloom.png" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"> This is the third game, I made for the UT Dallas Game Lab Course. This was actually the first game where we had to work with the Unreal Game
									Engine. Needless to say, this brought forth many challenges as we had to come to terms with the systematic differences between Unity's Prefabs and Unreal's Blueprints. Another problem
									we had to overcome was using Github for Version Control. Anyone who has ever worked with Unreal knows that using Github for version control is akin to trying to stuff a tiger into a fish tank.
								</p>
								<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">For this project, I worked on the Artificial Intelligence of the enemy. Using Unreal's Blackboard and Behavior Tree System, I was able to create a complex AI that was-for a few parts of production-
									genuinely too smart. Due to this, I also created a much less intelligent AI that could easily be molded to fit the current level's requirements. This was also my first time as a UI/UX programmer as well.
