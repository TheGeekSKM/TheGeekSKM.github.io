              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was my first foray into Virtual Reality Games and it was a wonderful experience.
                I was able to create a custom physics based character controller and duplicated it to be the second player. Essentially, both character controllers
                were the same, but the second player was just a mirror of the first player. </p>

              project management on my own, and consequently, learnt how to space out projects properly.</p>

                actually lived in the project files, allowing assets to communicate with assets in other scenes without being active in the game. On top 
                of that, I was tasked with creating the Player Movement System which allowed for both keyboard movement in an isometric game, but also a 
                mouse-based dragging movement system that also worked with isometric views. </p>

                I was mostly in charge of backend systems designing/programming. Most of my work was not in the visual department. I created 
                the fracture system that would cause objects to shatter upon a certain amount of force being exerted on them. I also created 
                a dialogue system that allowed for skipping of dialogue, editor tools for creating dialogue that were very designer friendly, 
                and dialogue box animations with a tweening library.  </p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This is the third game, I made for the UT Dallas Game Lab Course. This was actually 
                the first game where we had to work with the Unreal Game Engine. Needless to say, this brought forth many challenges as we had 
                to come to terms with the systematic differences between Unity's Prefabs and Unreal's Blueprints. Another problem we had to 
                overcome was using Github for Version Control. Anyone who has ever worked with Unreal knows that using Github for version control 
                is akin to trying to stuff a tiger into a fish tank.   </p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">For this project, I worked on the Artificial Intelligence of the enemy. Using Unreal's 
                Blackboard and Behavior Tree System, I was able to create a complex AI that was-for a few parts of production- genuinely too smart. 
                Due to this, I also created a much less intelligent AI that could easily be molded to fit the current level's requirements. 
                This was also my first time as a UI/UX programmer as well.  </p>
