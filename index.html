        <p class="projects__description">These are the previous projects that I have either been a part of and have completed. 
          I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from Virtual Reality Games to Board Games, and everything in between.

              <p class="projects__project-gameDescription">"In order to build a sandwich, you must fight the gods..."</p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was the second Virtual Reality game that I developed with a partner 
                (<a href="https://github.com/nicolasmaclean">Nick Maclean</a>). 
                This game allowed me to mess with VR Combat, especially with Melee Combat. I was able to create a 
                <strong>Melee Combat Template</strong> that is quite robust with little setup required.</p>

                yourself, by yourself. Bask in your utter loneliness and solitude with this game of ping pong."</p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was my first foray into Virtual Reality Games and it was a wonderful experience.
                I was able to create a <strong>custom physics based character controller</strong> and duplicated it to be the second player. Essentially, both character controllers
                were the same, but the second player was just a mirror of the first player. </p>

                .</p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was the first game that I developed myself and I really enjoyed working on it. 
                I took it through all the stages of development from <strong>Pre-Production</strong>, <strong>Alpha</strong>, <strong>Beta</strong>, and 
                <strong>Content-Lock</strong>. I basically experimented with doing
              project management on my own, and consequently, learnt how to space out projects properly.</p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was the first game that I developed for The University of Texas at Dallas Game Production 
                Course. I worked with a team of developers and was mainly in charge of developing a <strong>Custom Event System</strong> that did not live in scene but 
                actually lived in the project files, allowing assets to communicate with assets in other scenes without being active in the game. On top 
                of that, I was tasked with creating the <strong>Player Movement System</strong> which allowed for both keyboard movement in an isometric game, but also a 
                mouse-based dragging movement system that also worked with isometric views. </p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameDescription">"Race against time as you deliver food, all while a the behest of people far wealthier and far more well-fed than you!!"</p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This is the second game that I developed for UT Dallas. ToborQuest is a time 
                trial racing game where the goal is to deliver food from the start of the level to the end of the level. For this project 
                I was mostly in <strong>charge of backend systems designing/programming</strong>. Most of my work was not in the visual department. I created 
                the <strong>Fracture System</strong> that would cause objects to shatter upon a certain amount of force being exerted on them. I also created 
                a <strong>Dialogue System</strong> that allowed for skipping of dialogue, editor tools for creating dialogue that were very designer friendly, 
                and dialogue box animations with a tweening library.  </p>

            <div class="project__card">

              <p class="projects__project-gameDescription">"Step into the shadows of a twisted mind, where darkness reigns and secrets lurk, 
                in this chilling first-person horror puzzle game that will haunt your every move."</p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This is the third game, I made for the UT Dallas Game Lab Course. This was actually 
                the first game where we had to work with the <strong>Unreal Game Engine</strong>. Needless to say, this brought forth many challenges as we had 
                to come to terms with the systematic differences between Unity's Prefabs and Unreal's Blueprints. Another problem we had to 
                overcome was using Github for Version Control. Anyone who has ever worked with Unreal knows that using Github for version control 
                is akin to trying to stuff a tiger into a fish tank.   </p>
              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">For this project, I worked on the <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> of the enemy. Using <strong>Unreal's 
                Blackboard and Behavior Tree System</strong>, I was able to create a complex AI that was-for a few parts of production- genuinely too smart. 
                Due to this, I also created a much less intelligent AI that could easily be molded to fit the current level's requirements. 
                This was also my first time as a <strong>UI/UX programmer</strong> as well.  </p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was the first board game I made. It is a recreation of chess with more <strong>Warlike Mechanics</strong> 
                where each player is meant to steal a crystal from another player and guard it to win. </p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This is my second board game that utilizes various <strong>Randomness Mechanics</strong> to create a 
                <strong>Resource-Gathering Non-Kinetic Game</strong>. This basically means that the players cannot directly damage/hurt each other's progress and must
                only be able to improve their own progress in some way. An example of a non-kinetic game is Settlers of Catan (although the robber mechanic does
                somewhat defeat the definition of a non-kinetic game)</p>

              <p class="projects__project-gameLearning">This was a game that I developed as a <strong>Psychological Test</strong>. In the game,
