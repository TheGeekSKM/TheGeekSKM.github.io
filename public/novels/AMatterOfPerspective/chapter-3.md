### Chapter 3

"What do you think they might be discussing?"

Vira paused his pacing to ponder where the question might be coming from. He spotted a short and rotund figure, with a height that falls well below the average courtier. His stature, while modest, is accentuated by his plumpness, giving him a rounded and somewhat jovial appearance. Harsha Driverin sauntered over to Vira's balcony, overlooking the snowy woods and fields of Brugundia.

"In the last 15 minutes, what do you propose they have been whispering about, Vira?"

Vira let out a sigh. He realized that in his position on the balcony and in his zeal to find a spot alone to contemplate his situation, he had forgotten to pick a spot where could not be cornered. He sullenly realized he would have to entertain this rolling ball of cheese in order to escape this conversation alive. What made this situation more irritating was that Harsha was not at all as simple as Vira was hoping. Before Vira was appointed as head minister, everyone in the court was sure that Harsha would get the role, however when Harsha lost, he made no attempt to fight back against the appointment and accepted Vira with a jovial smile. This smile horrified Vira and kept him on his guard. This very same smile greeted him when he turned around.

"Hard to say. They have only been inside for a few minutes. I doubt the baron would be able to communicate all that he wanted to in such a short amount of time. Were I a betting man, I would bet that they had just finished a apprehensive set of introductions as they sized each other up."

Harsha chuckled. A laugh that was alien to Vira as it was not mechanical but felt...real. "Say you were a betting man, Vira. What angle would you wager the baron is using?"

Vira squinted. He had to answer carefully. He could not outright decry the baron as that would give Harsha some semblance of insight into his plans, but he could not blatantly remain loyal as this would immediately be spotted by Harsha as a lie-another form of insight. He had to deliver his thoughts in such manner that would please Harsha if he supported the baron, but also please Harsha if he detested the baron. After a long pause, Vira spoke. "I do not know. I can't place a bet from such a distance, but I am more than willing to stake my livelihood on the baron being very careful. In his ill state, he would be careful enough to put forth a presence of weakness, to show the hunter that he means no harm. It would probably benefit the baron to have the hunter off guard."

"What? You think he will the pity card? Our baron? The man who screams at his servants even while suffering from some hideous disease?" Harsha retorted.

"Why not? What would he lose? This hunter is a stranger to our town. He knows not of the baron's fits. As far as he's concerned this is just a rich old man who wants to see his wife and son before he dies. Perhaps the pity card is the only card he has left to play."

"I cannot deny," Harsha praised, "Quite the insight. No wonder you became the head minister. But...a query, if you don't mind."

Vira slowly nodded. After dealing such praise a question or two was probably acceptable. "I suppose we're not short on time, go on."

"What exactly do you think the baron will say? Do you think he'll be honest?"

Vira almost scoffed, but managed to keep the spasm to a subtle cough, a cough that he hoped Harsh didn't notice. He glanced a quick look over to his compatriot. Harsh stood still, awaiting an answer. If he had noticed the cough, he was not showing it.

"Honest? What purpose would that serve him. His own people don't know of his actions. He wishes to repent, true. But repentance can only be achieved before a certain threshold is crossed."

"A threshold which the baron has already crossed?"

Vira grew nervous. Why did Harsha ask him that question? Was he genuinely a buffoon or was he asking to see which side Vira, himself, landed on this threshold?

"I cannot answer that. You know the story, I shall let you decide."

Harsha chuckled at the response. Vira smiled. He escaped Harsha's trap and even Harsha realized it.

"Always the clever one, eh Vira? Fine fine. No more targeted questions. Sincerely, though. Don't you think the baron would have it in his best interests to be honest?" Like you said he is an old dying man with nothing to lose. No pride no dignity, especially at his old age. And even the hunter would appreciate honesty. I presume candor is a trait that the hunter rarely sees."

"Veracity would be a virtue that the hunter might find refreshing, indeed. But you cannot sincerely believe the baron will tell the full story."

"Why not?"

This time, Vira let the scoff escape his throat. "After what he's done?! What you think he'll just tell the baron that he beat his wife until she made a deal with a demon and fucked it to have a child?! And now that child lives in the woods with her, where she eternally torments the poor creature to drain it of the demonic powers it wields?!"

"Alright, maybe he won't be too honest. This does beg the question: How will we convince the hunter? If the baron will lie, as you say he will, how would we get the hunter on our side?" Harsha asked.

"Simple. If the baron lied, we could spill the truth. Even if he chose to believe the baron, a seed of doubt would be planted in his mind. A seed that, being a hunter, would probably eat him alive with questions. If the baron decided to be brutally honest, then the hunter will leave the castle with a poor taste in his mouth and we could be there to sweeten his mood with another deal." Vira proclaimed.

"You honestly believe we'll convince him to kill the child?? He might be a hunter, but killing an innocent creature...I can't see how he'd agree, Vira."

"Why would he not agree?"

"My apologies, I do not follow." Harsha said. Vira smiled. He understood a concept of his plan that Harsha did not. He could now be free to educate his pupil.

"It's quite simple. We ask the hunter a question: what do you think happens to the child when it comes back into the town? What happens to the spawn of a demon if it tries to live among other mortal creatures? The answer would present itself clearly to the hunter: The child will be torn to shreds by the villagers. Everyone in town has herd of the rumors. Everyone will be up in arms at dawn, pitchforks in hand, and skin the child alive."

"These rumors," interjected Harsha, "Might not entirely be true. The child might not be demon spawn."

Vira turned fully, for the first time, to face Harsha and stared directly at him. "The credibility of a rumor matters not. The speaker might be conveying a myth, a legend, or a lie, even. That does not make it any less true to the listener. As the listener mutates into a speaker, themselves, so too will the rumor mutate, spreading like a disease in the body of a crippled old man." Vira hesitated. He had said too much. He turned and bit his cheek.

"Well then," Harsha agreed, "Let us rid ourselves of this plague of a baron."

Vira glanced another look and for the first time in a long time, saw seriousness. The smile which taunted him all this time faded to reveal a look of determination of subtle seething hatred. Harsha, although his motives somewhat unclear, was human after all, and how Vira had some insight into his friend's intentions. Vira knew that they would probably continue to attempt to dethrone each other, but in the meanwhile, they will maintain a tentative truce. First, they would kill the child, then the baron, and lastly, each other.
