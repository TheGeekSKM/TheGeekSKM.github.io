### Chapter 4
Harsha grimaced and cursed. He trudged behind his head minister as Vira seemed to effortlessly and delicately traverse the sea of courtiers, all of whom were slamming their way into the courtroom. Harsha, however, being a bit shorter and gaining some more mass during his tenure as minister, found it incredibly difficult to squeeze past his peers. Occasionally, a courtier or a soldier would step on his prized leather boots, cushioned comfortable in the soles with layers of cotton, all stitched by some of the best shoemakers in all of Ennorim. Harsha would stop and attempt to yell at the courtier, but then suddenly be pushed by another. Eventually, he made his way to the throne to reconvene with Vira, however Harsha knew in his heart that he did not arrive on purpose, but by sheer luck as the wave of people beached him in front of his comrade.

Vira looked at him and nodded. Harsha, out of breath and unsuccessfully hiding it, nodded back. Vira was quite a intruiging figure in Harsha's mind. He was always held in high regard by Harsha due to his quick wit and cunning. Moreover, Harsha was just excited to have a partner in crime, a partner who-according to Harsha-respected his opinions and input.

Vira stepped forward and Harsha mirrored as they made their way to the hunter, who at this point was rumaging through his burlap sack. He pulled out empty potion vials from one pouch and put it in his pocket gingerly as his other hand began sorting through some herbs in another pouch.

Both Vira and Harsha looked at each other and Harsha silently signaled that Vira should do the talking. Vira's eyebrows moved, but Harsha had a really hard time deciding whether this was a response or a stroke. Vira nodded. Harsha nodded back. Vira looked to his left emphatically. Harsha slowly and with great confusion looked to his right quizzically. Vira slapped his forehead and stared at Harsha. Harsha, finally caught on to the code. He raised his hand and slapped Vira's forehead.

"No, you fucking mongrel!" Vira screeched.

Harsha recoiled. Evidently, this secret language was far more nuanced than he thought. This did, however, gain the attention of the hunter, who stared at both men with an unmistakeable expression of confusion.

Vira cleared his throat and spoke, "Ah, so you must be the hunter. My comrade and I have heard quite a great amount about you. I must say, it is quite the honor."

The hunter stared directly at Vira, almost as it he was analyzing Vira's soul. "That might just be the most unusual thing a minister has ever said to me", the hunter said. His accent caught Harsha offguard. Clearly, he must not be from Averon. Perhaps he came from another continent. He lit up at the thought. As a newcomer, the hunter would be quite unaware of the relationship between the sickly aging baron and his two ambitious ministers.

"We understand the controversy of your profession, sir", Harsha added, "but we also recognize its necessity. Someone must do what no other creature is willing to do. You have our respects, sir."

"You don't have to call me sir. My name is Solomon Krynweld, and your respect is noted."

"Well Mr. Krynweld," Vira continued, "I was wondering if you had a moment of time for my partner and I. I believe we could have a very enlightening conversation."

"What about?" said Solomon, who paused his search through his pack and now stood straight up, standing taller than the average person with broad shoulders, and dark brown hair that lied behind his head with several strands making their way in front of his face. He stood stiff but not frozen and had a slight lean towards the ministers. Harsha realized that at any given moment, Solomon could leap forward and remove his throat from his body. Harsha gulped.

"We-Well, it would be a quite short conversation, I assure you. We shan't take, uh, too much of your time, sir" Harsha stuttered.

Solomon's eyes narrowed and he turned his full gaze on Harsha. Quickly, Harsha had a small moment to run some calculations in his head and with a great amount of evidence, came to the well-researched conclusion that if both him and Vira were to run, Solomon would probably catch up with Harsha first.

"Short and enlightening," Solomon scoffed, "I didn't even know that combination was possible, let alone that it would be offered to someone like me by people like you." He began to crush some herbs and hold the vials up to the light streaming in from the stained windows as he measured liquid.

Harsha suddenly lost the ability to gulp as his saliva seemingly evaporated out of him. He looked at Vira for back up and was met with a look of irritation from his comrade. Harsha did not mind though. His fear of Solomon far outpaced his respect for his friend.

"I see you are not a fool, hunter. I see that you understand the strain in our relationship. But, I would like to be able to assume that you are intelligent enough to-", Vira stepped closer to Solomon to mutter the rest in a much quieter voice. Solomon froze once again and stared intently.

"-realize that our dear baron is not operating at full capacity. He is ill not just physically, but mentally as well. I would like to believe you noticed this. My friend-who is clearly beyond terrified of you-and I both have much clearer minds. Clear enough to offer a counter-proposition to what the baron may have offered."

Solomon turned to look questioningly at Vira who now stood as a barrier between Harsha and the hunter. Harsha thanked his friend in his mind and made a mental promise to buy his comrade the most expensive wine as soon as possible.

"How do you already know what your boss wants from me?" asked Solomon, also in a low voice.

"Like I said," Vira replied, "the baron is not of a sane mind. Any common ingrate can figure out his motives long before he utters them from his own mouth. The way, I see it, Solomon, you have two options at hand. If you wish to get a larger and honest view of the situation you have found yourself in, come with us and we shall have a quick and painless conversation regarding details. However, if the rumors of your kind are true, and if all you are is a bloodthirsty creature that is born and bred only to hunt, we wish you all the best on your journey into the woods."

Solomon's face twisted. Harsha unwillingly let out a squeal as he stared into the face of evil, itself. After a moment of silence, a dreadful and horrifying moment of unending silence, the evil opened its mouth to respond.
