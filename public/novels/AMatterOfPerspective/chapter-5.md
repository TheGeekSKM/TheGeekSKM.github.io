### Chapter 5
"Trust me, young man! I am the paragon, nay, the pinnacle of honesty. You do not need some ridiculous tincture of a few dozen variations of alcohols and spirits! You need this!"

The alchemist waved a small glass bottle, filled about three quarters to the top with a reddish substance that swirled inside.

The little boy looked confused. "Sir, isn't this also a mix of different alcohols?"

The alchemist groaned, "Child, if you had a pitiful amount of my knowledge and experience, you would know-without fail-that this is indeed the medicinal concoction your heart so desires. This will cure all your ailments!"

In spite of the quite commendable effort on behalf of the alchemist to keep his composure from erupting upon the insolent little child, the boy somehow found the right spot to launch an attack. "So what's the difference then?"

"THAT IT WILL CURE YOUR SHITTIN' AILMENTS!!!" The alchemist screamed. He swore he could feel the steam erupt from his ears, his nose, and his mouth. He felt leathery wings emerge from his now scaly body and he wished nothing more than to devour the child and fly away into his horde of gold and jewels and rest until the end of time.

"Alright alright. I'll give you 5 silver pieces." The boy's haunting curses of evil tore apart the alchemist's dream.

"Five? My boy, this tincture is worth more than the crown of the baron himself! The great sages of alchemy would flock from the highest peaks to gain access to this bottle and you think I would sell it to you for a measely-"

"-Where are they?" The boy looked around the empty store filled with more vials and tinctures that living creatures. In fact, most of the living creatures were stored in other vials in the laboratory behind the shop.

"We-well you...erm...must have caught me in an awkward time. You see-"

"That's why I offered you an awkward price." The kid smiled a sinister smile that would haunt the most despicable of demons from the heart of hell, itself.

The alchemist just groaned. "Fine! Here's your vial. Drink one sip daily and thank you for choosing to shop at The Fountain of Youth."

The kid chuckled to himself, clearly pleased with his dubious and malicious acts of pure evil, handed over the silver pieces, and skipped out of the store. The only sound that resonated was the sound of the wooden swinging on its hinges, kicking up dust with every creak. The alchemist sighed and then chuckled to himself. He turned his back to the door and began rummaging for his leather-bound journal. 

The door creaked again, but this time, it did not creak back into a closed position. The alchemist froze. He slowly turned around to see a man. Tall, although appearing even taller with the wide-brimmed hat on his head and the two swords on his back. Silvery white hair erupted from his scalp, only to be roughly wrought together with a few strands of smaller twine. He wore clothes that would have once passed for the clothes of the rich nobles that dotted the lands, but the tears and bloodstains have definitely lowered the price of the cloth by a significant margin.

"Only a slight upcharge," the alchemist thought to himself as he smiled a warm welcoming smile.

"WELCOME WEARY TRAVELER TO THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH, THE ONLY STORE THAT CAN HEAL YOU AND YOUR-"

The man held up his hand before the alchemist could finish. The alchemist's face twisted into disappointment and his hands dropped back to his side.

The man stepped forward and spoke as he eyed around the store, "My apologies, sir. I was lookin' for a herbalist, but some ministers told me that you're the best I have around here."

The alchemist, upon hearing the praise, puffed his chest slightly.

The man continued. "I'm lookin' for some silverroot, golden nectar thorns, and a few quarter flasks. I'd prefer round-bottom flasks if you don't mind."

The alchemist let out a quiet grumble. "A fellow alchemist, are we?"

"Not exactly. I just know a few simple potions is all. I do enjoy potion-craft though." 

The alchemist shook his head slowly, put his hands up in a gesture of resignation, and motioned to the rest of the store. "Fresh out of silverroot, I'm afraid. The elven raider cleared out several of the fields with fire, those filthy arrowheads!"

The man just stared at the alchemist. A drop of sweat rushed down the alchemist's forehead as the room suddenly became hotter than the deserts of Dreathor. "Bu-but I have already made some Potions of Healing with the last of my silverroot, if you'd like to buy them, sir. 2 gold a bottle!" The alchemist chuckled nervously.

The man stepped even closer. At this point, he was close enough to have one of his swords remove the alchemist's head and paint the shelves behind him. The alchemist gulped.

"Was it the same potion you gave to the kid? If I remember correctly, you sold it for 5 silver, no?"

The alchemist's jaw dropped. "How the devil did you hear-"

The man pointed to his ear. "I have good hearing."

"We-well fine! I'll sell it to you for the same price, BUT NO LESS!!"

The man just sneered, a cold calculated sneer that sent an itch down the alchemist's spine.

"Nah, you can keep 'em. Your heartbeat's tellin' me you're lyin'. You and I both know, that the potion you just sold is nothing but some alcohol mixed with sugar. Now I got no problem with lyin'. It's an integral part of makin' a living."

The man leaned closer until the alchemist could see the bright yellow pupils.

"But you don't lie to kids," the man growled in a guttural demonic voice.

The alchemist stumbled over his words, "W-w-what do you-"

"Tell 'em you lied and pay them back. Just fuckin' do it."

The alchemist risked a quizzical look at the man, "What of your potions then? Will you wander off into the woods to find silverroot? I did not lie about the crops!"

The man began to walk away before he froze. He just stood and stared at the door for what seemed to be an eternity to the alchemist before he sighed a deep sigh.

"Actually, before I forget," the man sighed as he walked back to the shivering alchemist and stopped walking right before the alchemist emptied his bowels. "I'd like three packages of tea leaves, please."

"Ahhh....a fa-uh fan of r-r-reading the future...?"

"Nah...I..uh..I really like tea."

A few minutes later, the door swung open and then it creaked back. The sounds of the hooves outside and a whinny of a horse as it galloped off into the distance reverberated in the shop. The alchemist sunk to the ground, dumbfounded. Quickly, he grabbed his leather-bound journal and wrote hurriedly: "THREE THOUSAND POUNDS OF SILVERROOT AND A BUNCH OF TEA!!!"
