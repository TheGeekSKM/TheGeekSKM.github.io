### Chapter 6

She waited impatiently.

Hiding behind the overgrown trees, she listened and waited. The oak-brown clock with lighter undergarments allowed her to blend into the army of thick trees that dotted the forest. She had long black hair which, instead of being tied behind her head into a delicate bun like she was taught to do, was let loose inside the hood of her cloak. She admired the practicality of a bun, but she preferred simplicity.

It was not until she heard the sound of quiet footsteps, dripping with water from the nearby creek, that she turned and looked around her tree. She bent low and kept her hands on the muddy snow-covered ground, her pale fingers turning both brown from the mud and red from the cold, as she peered from the base of the trunk. Fortunately, she found the elves.

"Oi!" she yelled, slowly emerging from the trunk with her arms held above her head. "I'm over here."

The elves, who upon the high-pitched sound of her voice immediately readied their long bows and steel swords, lowered them upon seeing their best customer. She smiled as she stepped forward, putting on her best and prettiest face. The elves shifted slightly. She smiled wider. It turned out that mud, snow, and dirt had no effect on her beauty.

"Have you procured the silverroot?" she asked.

"Yes madam. We managed to cut the crops in the process as well." The elves spoke slowly. While most elves that had integrated themselves into common society had not trouble with communicating, wood elves that resigned themselves to living a life far from the toil of society spoke slowly and with a stilted accent that clearly displayed their disgust towards the common language.

"Brilliant! How much silverroot have you managed to get?" She began ruffling through her cloak and pushed aside a pendant stored in her sash to find the pouch of healing potions she had hidden away.

"We were able to find about three bushels."

She froze. "Only three?? And you expect me to pay you for that?!"

The lead elf turned to his comrades. They both looked at him with a similar look of irritation that she carried on her face. It seemed that frustration was the Great Equalizer-a tool of communication that can be understood regardless of any language barriers. The lead elf lowered his head for a moment, before turning back towards her.

"Madam Runehart, please-"

"Do NOT call me that!"

Everyone froze. The wind howled against the trees. The snow began to fall again, drifting aimlessly in the wind until it was thrown onto the ground. The wood of the trees creaked and groaned.

"I can give you one potion for three bushels. Nothing more." she spoke carefully.

"That will not do madam," the lead elf said with a hint of dismay. "You have failed on your shipment of potions before. I do not believe you are able to negotiate now. We agreed to give you as much silverroot as we found, and to destroy the crops of Brugundia. In return, we ask for our price of ten potions to be respected."

She cursed under her breath, although she suspected that the elves probably heard her. At most, she only had five vials in her pouch. She figured the elves would be able to bring enough silverroot to brew five more, but now she promised more than the could deliver. She cursed again.

All four of them looked at each other. In any other instance, they might have noticed that all four of them had not had a proper meal yet. Neither did they have a chance to bathe themselves or even sleep peacefully. Instead, all they noticed was that everyone had their hands on a bow, a blade, or hidden behind a cloak. They stared at each others pupils.

"My name is Esma Runehart," she whispered.

The lead elf furrowed his brow in confusion.

She shrugged slightly as her fingers slipped into another pouch filled to the brim with various pockets containing all kinds of substances. She curled her hands around a small bit of squirrel fur, a small shard of glass, and three silver pins with blunt ends.

"I do not like telling my name to anyone, but I do not mind telling it to the dead."

The lead elf's eyes widened in fear. Immediately, Esma crushed the ingredients as a small trickle of blood seeped from her palm from the shard of glass. She screamed an incantation in an ancient language that was lost many centuries ago. The blood mixed with the ingredients as her hand began to glow and buzz. She held it forward and screamed a shrill scream with a volume that seemed impossible given her stature. From the sliver of space between her fingers and her nails, the dirt melted away as sparks of lightning shot forward. They whizzed and whirled with a purple glow and raced towards the elves. One of the elves managed to nock an arrow into their bow. Unfortunately, before the arrow could leave their bow, their face dissolved.

The lead elf and one of his comrades instantly felt their skin evaporate as their blood and muscles, now visible for the world to see, boiled from the lightning and froze from the cold weather. The screamed and howled in pain and fear burned through their minds as they slowly dissolved into the ground, the snow turning blood red from their leaking corpses.

One of the elves, who got surprisingly lucky managed to dash behind a tree and run before the tree splintered from the lightning.

Esma gasped for air and then gritted her teeth.

She ran after the elf.

The chase was beginning to seem fruitless. His speed was far greater than hers. She was also experiencing fatigue. The spell she had cast was not a common spell that was taught to any novice witches and wizards, but a spell that could only be learned by pouring through old tomes and experimenting profusely. Due to the taxing nature of spell-casting, she began to slow.

Esma cursed. She would have to use another spell, which would make her even more tired. She could use a simpler spell, but she needed to ensure that the elf would die. Any chance of his survival could bring attention to her. She cursed her hubris and had to take the risk of a powerful spell.

She cast both hands into the air and screamed an incantation at the top of her lungs, waving her hands and crafting geometric patterns in the air with her fingertips, she threw her hands into the ground. A thick yellow-green vapor emerged around the elf and surrounded him.

The wind was still racing through the trees, but Esma isolated the sound coming into her ears to only listen for the elf's footsteps. They slowed, and then they stopped. Followed by a wet thud into the ground. Silence.

At least it was somewhat silent, until she heard a voice.

"Hello, miss."

She turned around and despite her muscles sore and her throbbing headache, she lifted her arms into the air and moved them towards the sound.

"Whoa! I ain't here to fight!" he said sternly. He was wearing a tan, light-brown shirt-piece that seemed to emulate sophistication and nobility, but was covered in mud and dried blood which quickly dispersed any assumption of high-class society. He wore a hat on his head, and spoke in an accent that seemed to come from far away.

"My name's Solomon Krynweld. I'm a hunter and I would like some help if you don't mind, miss."

Esma stared at Solomon with vitriol. She cared not if Solomon saw her hatred. It seemed Solomon did indeed see the seething anger that radiated from her.

"It ain't for you ma'am. I'm coming from Brugundia, and I was hired to find a little boy and his mother. The baron's kid and wife," he stated.

Esma froze. The anger in her body froze as well until it curdled into fear. Cold frozen fear.

"I figure," he continued, "that you might be a spellcaster. I was wonderin' if you could cast a spell for me."

She stared at his eyes, but they gave her no comfort. No humanity could be found, no sense of empathy, no emotion at all could be seen in his eyes. She shivered.

"From what I've been told, they're carryin' a pendant of sorts. A pendant with a royal crest. The wife, see, she keeps a pendant from her home. If you could locate that object, I'll head off and leave you alone."

"I apologize, sir," she responded, "Unfortunately, that spell requires materials that I do not have on hand at the moment. Now if you were able to produce a map, I might be able to give a general layout of the fores-"

"I'm sure you can find a forked twig in a forest ma'am. Hell, I even see one on a tree near ya." He squinted his eyes.

Esma cursed internally. Not only did she hate strangers, she especially hated strangers who could read, and most of all, she hated strangers who could read books about spells and their requirements.

"Of-of course," she stammered. She looked around and managed to find a twig hanging near her. She cursed the twig before pulling it out.

Normally, she would have either just run, or attempted to kill the intruder, but she was aching from her previous scuffle. She figured she would attempt to lie again. She dropped the branch, hoping it looked like an accident, and slowly bent at her hips and with the grace of the goddess of love, herself, pick up the branch. She rested her one hand on her hip and reoriented herself until she was the pinnacle of beauty.

"I must apologize again, sir," she muttered slowly,"I believe the spell you asked me to cast is a bit too powerful to be in my repertoire. You must forgive me."

The man stared at her. She stared back but with much less confidence. She hated presenting herself, but it was a gift she learned to use well over the years. It worked on the elves for a brief moment. Hopefully it would work on him as well.

"Why would you lie?" the man whispered. He actually looked a tad bit disappointed.

Esma shuddered and snapped out of her pose. The man reached his hand for his hat, but instead pivoted and let his hand rest on the handle of a sword that rested on his back.

"I saw you, miss. I saw you cast lighting from your fingers. Not just a ball of lightning that affects an area on the ground or a singular lone target, but three elves at the same time. Then, I saw you contemplate. You could either let the remaining elf live or you could kill it. First, I thought you were fighting in self defense. I heard that there were elves burning crops so I assumed that you were protecting yourself. But if you were protecting yourself, you would've let that last elf run away. You needed them all dead because they must have known somethin' that other people didn't need to know. See, your husband mentioned you were a spell-caster so I had a hunch. But you lyin' just made it real clear."

He kept arcing around her as he spoke but froze near a tree at the end.

"Where's the kid?" he growled.

Esma gritted her teeth and cursed again. Without hesitation, she cast her hand forward and threw a burning mote that exploded into a bolt of fire, but Solomon was too quick.

He slithered along the edge of the tree that he back up to and found cover from the fire.

Esma lost sight of him as he went behind the trunk, but she knew the flames would draw him out. She was not wrong, but she failed to calculate the speed with which he would emerge.

He leaped at her in a feral rage, both swords unsheathed from his arched back. He sprinted forward and before she could cover herself, he sliced into her. Not just once, but thrice. He carved into her as each strike from the blade tore through her leather armer and cut deep into her skin.

She yelped. She did not have much energy left and had to resort to casting as few spells as possible. Instantly, she figured she could run. He might be able to get a slash into her, but she would be able to swallow a healing potion as she ran. She leaned forward and pushed against his broad chest, using the momentum to launch her away from him. He was able to get one more slash into her back before she turned tail and ran. Fishing in her cloak, she grabbed a vial of red liquid that glowed slightly and hungrily gulped it down. A horrible sensation of itching momentarily rocked her body as her wounds slightly closed.

As she ran, she kept listening for his footsteps, but her heart pounded as she realized she couldn't hear them. Instead, it was not long until one of his blades caught her foot causing her to stumble.

He raced forward and managed to reach her, but Esma used the fall to face herself towards her hunter. As Solomon reached her, she used her hands to quickly reach into her clock and find the pocket with frozen eyelashes encased in gum arabic from the nearby trees. She muttered an incantation as the gum fused into her skin as her form shuddered and her body turned invisible.

With difficulty she limped up and began to sprint away from Solomon as fast as she could. She raced towards her house. Inside, she might be able to find a potion to replenish her spells.

"I can still hear you!" the man roared.
 
Esma screamed back, "PLEASE!! Leave us alone! You don't know what I have been through. I beg you, please."

"You husband told me, Esma." The man said.

Hearing her name, sent a jolt of pain through her back. Esma stopped and turned to see the man facing in her direction, but slowly walking instead, both swords sheathed.

"He told me what he did to you," the man continued. "You don't have to forgive him. In fact, I would recommend you never forgive him, but his son deserves a better life than in the woods, doesn't he?"

Esma hid behind a tree and kept her eyes on Solomon as he approached a small clearing and stopped. "The life he has in the woods is far greater than the one he would have had in the castle. Dieter would have beat him and done horrible things to him. Even now, Dieter doesn't want a child, he wants a successor," she replied.

Solomon stopped, and began looking around and seemingly unintentionally, turned his back to her. Esma saw this as an opportunity. She slipped her hands into her boots and pulled out a small obsidian blade.

Solomon spoke softly, but loud enough to be heard, "So why don't ya let the kid decide. He's what? Ten? Let the kid visit the city and decide what he wants. If he wants to come back, I'll personally bring him back myself.

Esma needed Solomon to remain distracted as she crept closer with a knife. She was never really good at lying as her face betrayed her, but the invisibility should give her an advantage. Third time is always a charm, after all.

"I've always wanted a child," she spoke, trying her very best to sound more tired than she was,"I just wanted to be a mother for most of my life. I wanted to be able to look into my child's eyes and see love that I never got. But Dieter...he did things to me. He did everything to me but could not give me a child. But now, I have one. Yes, it is the spawn of a demon. Yes, it might bring about great danger. But it is mine. Please. I am begging you. Please-"

With the final plead, she leaped forward and brought her knife down into Solomon's back.

However, the knife planted itself into Esma's back instead.

As Esma leapt forward, Solomon turned, and despite her invisibility, he locked eyes with her. As she reappeared midair, Solomon seemed to move faster than time itself as he grabbed the blade from her hand, spun as she landed on the ground, and fell on top of her, with the blade plunged into her back. She screamed.

Solomon laid still on top of her silently. Instinctively, in a fit of absolute fear, she began clawing in the direction of the house. She screamed. She kicked. She tried to grab onto Solomon, but he did not move. She turned her head side to side and began to cry. She wept. The fear melted away into frustration as she cursed her miserable life.

They told her to get married; they told her to not practice magic; they told her to have a child instead and slave her self away into motherhood. She did everything they said and this was how she was to be repaid?!

She just let her face rest in the snow as the snowflakes rested gently upon her delicate cheeks. Her tears just kept streaming constantly as the fear returned slowly.

Her vision began to fade as Solomon held her. She yelped out but she knew what was to come. Solomon must have seen her attempt to claw towards the cabin and he got all the information he needed. She wished, in her final moments, that he recognized the futility of her life.

It was not fair. It was never fair. It was-
