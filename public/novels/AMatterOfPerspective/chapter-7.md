### Chapter 7
"NOT FAIR!!" screamed the child.

He stood in the tundra, wrapped in tough leather as his hands stood firm to his side. He stared at the majestic deer in front of him. Around him and his quadrupedal arch-nemesis lied a shallow bucket dropped on its side. The deer was surveying the bucket without considering the child's previous ownership of it.

"THAT WAS MINE!!!"

The deer lifted its head with a level of disdain that no bipedal creature could understand. It stared at the miniature lump of flesh that dared to utter loud sounds in its presence. With a grunt, it lowered its head again and began feasting on the carrots nestled in the bucket.

"We-well could you leave me a few, please?" the child croaked. His frustration got the best of him and tears were forming in his eyes.

The deer paid no heed and within a few moments, ate, digested, and excreted the carrots, all in front of the now crying child. The deer observed. It came closer. The child was a boy. The deer stepped even closer till its wet snout was almost in the boy's face. The boy's tears seemed to run low as he wiped them away and stared back at the deer. It tilted his head. There was something different about the boy. It looked into the boy's eyes.

Hatred. Malice. Death.

The deer leaped back, shaking. It tripped on itself as the boy screamed curses at it. It cried as it desperately scrambled away. It didn't now how far it would have to run. It didn't know how long it would have to run. But it knew to keep running forever. It knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that death from exhaustion was far more forgiving than being caught in the hands of that cursed beast.
