### Chapter 8

"YOU FORGOT ONE OF THE CARROTS, MS. DEER!!!"

Unfortunately, it was useless. Erowyn picked up the remaining carrot with his freezing short fingers. He brushed off some of the dirt and with a sad resolve, decided to save it for his mother instead of eating it himself.

He shrugged as he waddled over to his bucket, dragged it behind him, and made his way deeper into the frozen woods. Lucky for him, he knew the way back to his mother's house. It was just a few right turns and then a left. Or was it a few left turns? No no no, it had to be a few right turns. How else would he have passed the small bunny had he not taking a few left turns earlier. That must absolutely mean that he was to take a few right tur-

Erowyn's racing omnidirectional thoughts stopped as he bumped into his mother's house.

He looked at it with immense surprise and looked around to make sure that the bunny didn't see him. Rubbing his forehead and chuckling to himself, he grabbed his bucket and wandered into the house. The door was slightly ajar. That meant that his mother hadn't returned yet. Erowyn frowned. He entered inside and laid the bucket on the floor and gently placed the carrot on a table. He looked over to the pot in the edge of the single room house and immediately slapped his forehead with his stubby hand.

"Not again!" he groaned as he made his way towards the pot of boiling water. Quickly, with the confidence that can only come from intense repetition, Erowyn slammed his fist into the wall on his right, causing snow to fall in through a hole in the roof. He grabbed as much snow as he could and threw it on the fire. The fire, however, would not seem to give up without a fight. Erowyn leaned down on his knees and began slapping the snow until the fire gave out. He, then, got up and checked inside and much to his dismay, barely any water was left.

"Enough for two cups, though" he thought to himself. He glanced around the room and focused on the two makeshift beds on the other side of the house. To call them beds was giving the piles of cloth far more credit than they deserved, but Erowyn grew to appreciate them. At least, he found it better than sleeping on the muddy ground.

Before long, Erowyn snapped to attention, and began preparing the house for his mother's arrival. He folded up the bedsheets and placed them at the foot of the "beds". He cut up the carrot and used a bit of the water and a few tubes of ingredients to make a carrot stew-a stew which carries the lone singular quality of being somehow edible. He even gathered up some tea leaves, placed them in a small beaker, and with great care and a towel: scooped up the pot and poured the boiling water over the tea leaves. After everything was finished, Erowyn looked around the house and patted himself on the back with a wide confident smile. He peeked at the door, waiting for his mother to return. However, she never barged in.

"Another test?" Erowyn whispered. He quickly shook his head and tightly clenched his fists. He hated his mother's tests. Slightly worried, he put on his leather jacket and even more leather overcoat and opened the door, only to be greeted by a man covered in snow. The man wore clothes that seemed to not be made of leather, although, unlike Erowyn's leather clothes, the man had tears and scratches all over his. He had white hair that was somewhat tied behind his head, as if he attempted to tie all of it, but gave up quite quickly. He wore a hat, too.

"H-Hello," Erowyn greeted. He also noticed the man's eyes. Erowyn moved the door until only his head was poking out from the side.

Throughout his time in the house, Erowyn and his mother never really used a mirror. He knew his mother had one, but Erowyn was never allowed to use it. All he knew was his own distorted silhouette that he saw in the icy ponds in the woods. However, sometimes his mother would break a beaker and while she would throw the glass outside the house, Erowyn would sneak out and grab a piece of glass to see his reflection.

The man's eyes reminded him of his own. Not in the way they appeared, but in how they felt. Something about those eyes felt familiar to Erowyn.

"Are you my father?" Erowyn asked genuinely.

The question seemed to catch the man off guard as his eyes slightly widened.

"No."

"I see." Erowyn replied. "Can I help you? If you're looking for my mother, she hasn't-"

"I'm lookin' for you," he interrupted.

"Oh." Erowyn felt a bead of sweat drip down the back of his neck. He peeked without moving his head and saw a cutting knife to his left. Without visibly moving, he began to reach for it.

"I wouldn't reach for anything. Whatever you have behind that door, I dunno if it beats both of my swords," the man stated matter-of-factly.

Erowyn gulped. His hand stopped in place.

"I was sent by your dad," the man explained. "He told me to pick you up and deliver you to his place. Now, I can deliver you while you happen to be alive, or...I can deliver you while you are dead. In fact might actually make more money if I kill you right now. So...how do you wanna do this, kid?"

Erowyn paused. He knew without any hesitation the man was not lying. He realized that he would need to proceed very carefully and consider what he was about to say. But first, Erowyn needed more information.

"My human father or my demon father?" Erowyn asked cautiously, his eyes squinting.

"Not much of a difference, I guess. Why, you got a preference?"

"Nope. I haven't met either of them," Erowyn answered.

"Then how'd you hear about them?"

"Uh...well.." Erowyn looked at his leather boots and suddenly found a great deal of interest in their monotonous color scheme as his faced turned red. "There's a lady named Myra Stumpf and sometimes she hands out chocolates and sometimes she hands a few chocolates to me."

"And you heard about your fathers from her?"

Erowyn looked up at the man, his face still burning red. "Ms. Myra likes to talk alot. She doesn't know who I am, but she'll talk to anyone."

The man looked around and with a sense of disdain surveyed Erowyn's surroundings. "Alright. Get your stuff, we're heading out."

Erowyn's eyes widened with an idea. "Wait! Before we go, I have tea for my mother and me! I have to-"

"You're mother won't be here." The man said, looking outside the house.

"Where will she be?"

"I dunno. She seemed in a hurry, though."

Erowyn noticed that the man seemed in no rush to turn around and look at him. However, "in a hurry" is a very excellent description of his mother. Erowyn shrugged. "Well, would you like some tea?"

The man turned around and looked at Erowyn. He stared at Erowyn's eyes through his own squinted eyes. He looked at the beaker that had tea leaves in it along with a dark liquid. He looked back at Erowyn.

"Fine, but one cup-"

"One for you and one for me!" Erowyn darted towards the tea.

"No! That's not what-" the man sighed. Erowyn giggled.

He poured the tea into two cups and gave one to the man, who took his hat off, sat down and began taking long sips.

Erowyn shivered as he drank the hot tea, the freezing sensation seemingly vanishing into the evening.

"Should I make some more tea for the travel?" Erowyn asked.

"Why? Shouldn't take us too long?"

"But the town's at least five hours away and if you're taking me to my demon father's house...well I actually don't know how far that is..." Erowyn said.

"Maybe five hours on foot. But I have a horse," the man responded.

Erowyn drank his tea at lightning speed and burned most of his tongue in the process, but he didn't care. He jolted up and ran outside to see a tall brown horse with black hair on the back of its neck. He stared at it and it stared back. Erowyn grimaced. He waited for it to look into his eyes and run. The horse never did. It stared at him and just looked. Erowyn had no idea what it could be seeing, but whatever it saw in his eyes, did not seem to bother it. He reached out his hand to pet it and-

"I'd be careful," the man scared Erowyn who pulled his hand back fast enough to almost burst his shoulder out of its socket. The man continued, "Wyrm eats people that he doesn't like."

Erowyn stared back at Wyrm. He got a bit closer and whispered, "Is that true, Mr. Wyrm?"

He could hear the man chuckle behind him. Erowyn knew that horses cannot eat flesh. He knew that the only creatures that could had sharp teeth which were specifically used to rip muscle off of the bone, and although Wyrm was no ordinary horse, he also did not have the teeth necessary to eat flesh. However, he realized that whenever he pretended to be a little bit dumber, the older people around him seemed to relax.

He turned to look at the man who was gathering himself to prepare for journey. Erowyn glanced long enough to see a blade hidden in the man's vest. While there wasn't obvious blood on the blade, the vest itself had some dark brown patches. He looked at the sky and noticed the sun was beginning to set. He stared at his house and saw the door slightly swinging in the wind. He heard the door creaking and the vials inside tapping against each other. He knew-in that very instant-that his mother was probably dead and that this man had killed her. 

Erowyn began reasoning his conclusion. Why else would she not be back? She hated anyone getting near her vials, even Erowyn, himself. Why else would the man not show his face as he told Erowyn about his mother's whereabouts? Erowyn stared at the man and the woods surrounding them has he realized this. He then, looked at the snow-covered ground and gritted his teeth. For some reason, even though his own mother was probably dead, killed by the man who was likely kidnapping him from his home, Erowyn felt relief.

"At least, the man might feel bad about trying to kill me," Erowyn thought,"The tea will make him feel bad."

The man walked up to Erowyn and stared at him for a moment, before hoisting him up onto Wyrm's back. Erowyn yelped. It had been years since his mother yanked him off the ground and he had almost forgotten the joy it brought him. Just for a moment, it felt like he might fly.

The man climbed on after, placing Erowyn behind him as Wyrm complained.

"Thank you, Mr...uh.." Erowyn stammered.

"Krynweld."

"Thank you Mr. Krynweld and Mr. Wyrm" Erowyn beamed.

The man looked back at Erowyn, and Erowyn spread his smile as wide as he could. The man stared. After a moment, he turned back and pulled on Wyrm's reins as Wyrm began to trot out of the woods.

As Wyrm galloped through the trees at a breakneck pace, Erowyn saw the man's forearms. He saw skin that was riddled with scars. Some of them were unrecognizable, seemingly made by claws or teeth. But some of them, he recognized immediately. He looked down and-with one hand holding onto the man-tugged at his leather sleeve with his teeth. He held up his own forearm to the man's as the man looked down to see what was happening. His eyes narrowed.

"We have similar scars. I got mine from potion needles! What about yours?" Erowyn asked.

The man didn't respond. He stared straight ahead.

"Did they hurt for you? They kept hurting for me, but mother would say that no one else ever got hurt from needles." Erowyn continued.

After a moment, the man spoke up. "Your mom lied."

Erowyn went silent. He knew what he wanted to ask the man, but for some reason it hurt his throat to ask it out loud.

"Mr. Krynweld...is...is my mother a bad person?" Erowyn asked.

The man glanced back for a second before returning his gaze to the front. "I can't decide that. I barely knew her."

"But you did know her?"

Erowyn swore he heard the man curse under his breath.

"I can't say for sure if your mom was a bad person. I know some bad things happened to her when she was younger-things that she might not have deserved-but having a shit life doesn't mean you can be a shit person," The man responded. "The only person here who can probably decide that is you, kid."

"Oh. okay...well...she did lie to me...and sometimes she would scream at me...so..."

"Lyin' don't necessarily make you a bad person. Sometimes people lie for good reasons, but they ain't evil."

Erowyn's widened with surprise. "You can do that??"

Mr. Krynweld chuckled.

"So how do you know if someone lied to you for good or if they lied to you because they were bad?"

Mr. Krynweld pondered for a moment. He readjusted his hat before speaking. "Matter of perspective, I guess. Sometimes a good reason for someone can be a bad reason for someone else."

"Are you a bad person, Mr. Krynweld?"

Silence.

"Yeah."

This time, it was Erowyn's turn to be silent. He had the confirmation that he needed about Mr. Krynweld's lie regarding his mother. But he needed to know if Mr.Krynweld lied for a good cause. He was completely confused.

"I've done some bad things, kid," Mr. Krynweld continued.

"But did you have a shit life?"

More silence.

"Yeah...but that doesn't excuse what I've done."

"Am I a bad person, Mr. Krynweld?"

"I dunno, kid."

"Have I had a shit life?"

"I dunno..."

"Does that mean, that one day, I'll become a bad person?"

Silence.

Erowyn nodded slightly. "I don't know if my mother was a good person, Mr. Krynweld. I think she lied to me a lot...but I don't know if my mother was a bad person either. She gave me food when I was hungry and she would stay with me when I had nightmares. She scared me...but...I don't know if she was a bad person..."

Once again, silence. Only the sounds of hooves amidst the wind was audible.

The rocking motion made Erowyn sleepy as he held onto Mr. Krynweld. He knew what Mr. Krynweld had done, but he didn't feel scared. He remembered some of his worst memories. Moments in his mother's shack, when she would leave for days on end, and he would be all alone amidst the screaming winds outside. He would cry and cry for his mother. He would even scream and shout for her. He knew he hated her, but he felt scared without her. He held a little bit tighter and yawned. For some reason, he didn't feel as scared with Mr. Krynweld. He didn't feel angry. He honestly didn't know what he felt, but that it didn't hurt as much as it normally does. "I know you lied to me, too, Mr. Krynweld...and that makes you not a good person...but you don't seem like a bad person." 

A long period of silence followed as Erowyn drifted off to sleep. He could hear the rumbling sound of Mr. Krynweld's voice as all sounds faded out.

"Thanks, kiddo."
