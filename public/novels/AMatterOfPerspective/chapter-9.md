### Chapter 9

Erowyn awoke to find drool on his cheek. He looked up without moving his head to make sure that Mr. Krynweld didn't notice it. After confirming that, he slowly took his hand and wiped the drool. Looking around carefully, he decided the best place to put the drool was on Wyrm's butt. After all, Wyrm wouldn't notice, right? He delicately moved his hand towards the rump and then pl-

"Don't you dare put your spit on Wyrm," Mr. Krynweld said without turning his head.

Erowyn froze. "Sorry, Mr. Krynweld," he muttered. His face glowed bright red. He decided he would look around and attempt to distract himself. Fortunately for him, the faces of the townsfolk stared back at him. He even saw Ms. Myra look at him. This time, though, she pushed some children behind her and stood between them and him. Erowyn furrowed his brow. Why would she do that? She knows him. She's met him before. As he looked around, he began to notice people's faces. None of them looked pleasant. At best, Erowyn figured that some of the faces looked like they could not care any less, while others looked like they cared a little too much. He assumed that being ridden in on a horse while sitting behind a man with two swords on his back was probably more than enough to draw attention, but he could not make out why everyone seemed so nervous.

Mr. Krynweld kept riding forward until he stopped near the gates of the castle. Erowyn looked up at it. He only saw it from far and seeing it close up felt daunting. The structure stood tall against the cloudy sky, its massive stone walls looming over Erowyn as he shuddered. He could see outlines of of intricate carvings of battles against giants, dragons, and other creatures. He saw gates made of sturdy iron with jagged tips. He saw that atop the towers stood soldiers, carrying crossbows and standing next to cannons. Erowyn pondered how the cannons got up to the towers, but as he passed the gates all the thoughts of towers and cannons vanished. Inside the air was filled with tension. Erowyn had experienced this tension before. Unlike the fear of the howling winds, this tension came from quiet moments. Moments where nothing can be predicted, where the current silence can be ripped away very quickly.

Mr. Krynweld stopped. He turned his head to face Erowyn. "Alrighty. It's time to meet your dad." He nodded at a few soldiers who were making their way towards him, carrying heavy shields with spears. Erowyn could see the glow on the iron spears, and quickly compared them to the gates from earlier to come to the conclusion that the spears were recently sharpened. He grimly noted that they probably were sharpened for him. He looked back at Mr. Krynweld.

"Could you come with me, Mr. Krynweld?"

"I'll meet up with ya in a bit, kiddo. I gotta do somethin' first."

"What is it? Can you do it later?"

Mr. Krynweld smiled, took off his hat, and shook his head. "Sorry, kid. I gotta return some money. But I'll see ya in a bit."

"Promise?"

Mr. Krynweld stared at Erowyn and, with the straightness of a lump of clay, answered, "Promise."

Erowyn's heart sank but he nodded. Mr. Krynweld's job was completed and he really had no reason to stay. But the fear started to return. As Mr. Krynweld turn Wyrm around and galloped away, Erowyn clenched his fists for the second time that day.

Erowyn was directed to the heart of the castle. He could feel the cold winter wind vanishing as the heat of the castle's interior took over. He passed by several corridors and many paintings depicting great events in history. He heard about some of these events, but the stories that he heard and remembered were far different than how they were in the paintings. Some paintings had images of small humanoid dragons emerging from a graveyard of dead giant dragon bodies, but Erowyn gulped. He knew that humanoid dragons were not created that way. He figured the painters lied for a good reason.

After what felt like an eternity of walking, Erowyn stood in front of the doors leading to the what the soldiers called a "Great Hall". Erowyn timidly stepped inside. He looked at the opulent chair in the middle and yelped as a corpse sat on it.

"Erowyn?" the corpse croaked. It lifted its hand and pointed a finger at him. "Erowyn my boy....Welcome home..."

Erowyn looked at him. He did not want to keep looking at the corpse, but he could not seem to turn away. The corpse looked like him.

"Are you my father?" Erowyn asked.

"Yes, son."

Erowyn reminded himself to breath. He felt beyond uncomfortable. He wanted to run.

"Why am I here?" Erowyn asked.

The corpse leaned forward with great pain. "You are here....because I need a successor. I have not much time left, son. I need you to take my place."

Erowyn felt confused. Not at the predicament that he found himself in, but the anger that he felt. "Why didn't you bring me here earlier? Why didn't you bring mother here earlier?"

The corpse remained silent. Erowyn couldn't tell if it died or was thinking.

Finally, the corpse spoke, "Your mother and I feel no love towards each other anymore. She would not have come even if I requested it."

"Why?!"

"Because I hurt her, Erowyn....I did something really bad....and she will never forgive me for it."

"What did you do?" Erowyn grimaced. He didn't know if he wanted an answer?

"I gave her you....She never wanted you, but I made her have you," the corpse answered solemnly.

"She-she didn't want me?"

"No, son. No your mother probably did not love me to begin with. But I needed a child. So I tried and tried and tried....but nothing came of it. Your mother became sick and tired of trying over and over again. She made a deal with a demon. I do not know what he did but he created you...All because I wanted a child..."

"What....?"

"I understand it is a lot to take in at one moment, son, but-"

"If you wanted a child, why didn't you find me earlier?"

The corpse sat back and looked intently at Erowyn. "You....are demonspawn, Erowyn....Had I brought you into the castle, you would have....you would have been ridiculed. You would face hatred from your own people. No doubt you saw that very same hatred as you came to this castle."

"But I wouldn't have been cold, would I? I wouldn't have been scared, WOULD I?!"

The corpse did not respond.

"WHY DO YOU SUDDENLY WANT ME AGAIN?!! JUST TO TAKE YOUR CHAIR?! JUST TO-" Erowyn croaked. He began to cry. Tears began to stream down his face. "You didn't want me and your wife didn't want me. EVEN THE DEMON didn't want me, but now, just because you happen to be half-dead, you get to KILL MY MOTHER AND KIDNAP ME?!??!"

The corpse looked without any emotions at Erowyn. It looked around at the room and as Erowyn followed its gaze, he noticed that the room was beginning to shake.

"I know I've done horrible things, Erowyn. I know I have hurt people close to me. I know I will face the consequences of my actions in the pits of hell, and with my luck, my consequences will take the form of your real father. But what has happened in the past, has happened. The most important thing now is what needs to happen for the future. You, son, will be the owner of Brugundia. You will rule and you-STOP CRYING, BOY!"

Something broke. Something deep and dark in the pit of Erowyn's soul broke. He heard his mother screaming at him for crying, blaming the winter storm on him. He heard is father screaming at him for crying, promising him a miserable life amidst horrible people. Suddenly, he stopped crying. He looked at the corpse and the corpse shuddered under his gaze. He didn't know what the corpse saw, but he didn't care. He took a step towards the corpse and found himself immediately at the base of the fancy chair. He placed his hands on the corpses head and felt the thinning hair streaking from the scalp, the loose skin hanging over the skull. He placed his foot on the corpse's chest and pulled.

The sound of a bloodcurdling scream was followed by silence. The silence was quickly followed by the sound of muscle-fibers being pulled apart from the bones that held them. A repeated sucking sound reverberated around the Great Hall as Erowyn pulled the corpse's head and spine out of the body. Thick viscous-like blood poured from the stump, covering the chair and the surroundings. Some of the blood got on Erowyn's leather coat, but some of the blood got in his mouth. Erowyn swallowed. It tasted sweet. Suddenly, Erowyn felt hunger.

He kneeled near the base of the stump and began biting and chewing. He used his teeth, which were not meant for flesh, to repeatedly bite, chew, and scratch flesh off of the bone. Before his hunger could be satisfied, he heard the sounds of footsteps echoing. He turned to see the angry soldier-shaped flesh mounds walking towards him with sharp stick drawn towards him. Erowyn roared. He leaped forward, landing on one of the soldier's heads. He used his feat to wrap around the soldier's head as he pushed his way to another soldier's head. As Erowyn leapt, his feet dug into the soldier's skull and Erowyn felt goo between his toes. He began leaping from skull to skull till his entire body was bathed in the blood of several soldiers. Erowyn yelped with glee and rolled around in the blood. He began lapping it off the floor as tears poured down his face. He stopped and looked at the body sitting in the fancy chair. He saw the headless corpse sitting there. He looked down and saw himself in the pool of blood beneath him. He saw his face darkened from blood and viscera. He couldn't even make out his own face, except for the glowing eyes that greeted him. Erowyn wailed.

He arched his back and rolled and twisted and turned. He screamed and yelled and shouted until his lungs gave out. He hugged the dismembered heads close to him, allowing the blood to wash over him. Looking back at the corpses, he began crying silently again. Wanting to stop his tears, he gingerly reached his hands into the base of one of the heads and began pulling out pieces of flesh from inside. He could barely make out a shape as he brought it closer to his mouth. He closed his eyes to shut off the tears as he swallowed the flesh. It tasted divine. Joy raced through his mind as the world twisted and shivered in his eyes. Erowyn scooted forward and shoved his head into another, gulping, biting, and drinking.

Sometimes, the joy would vanish, but Erowyn solved this problem by eating more flesh, prompting the joy to quickly return.

Soon, guards began pouring in, and the boy cackled with pleasure. He began to jump with a level of happiness he had never experienced before. A level of happiness so great that Erowyn began pulling out his own hair from the excitement. The pain of the his scalp ripping off of his head rang until the world stopped turning. Erowyn began to feel again.

"NO!!" he growled. "NOOOO!!!!!"

The creature howled as it galloped into the fray of guards. Swords swung in the air as shields bashed in front of them, but it was of no avail. The creature ripped into the bodies of the guards and tore through the other side. It ripped off the faces of the fallen guards and threw the skin at other guards to distract them.

The creature heard shouting. It looked up as it saw a few people dressed in fine robes enter the hall, only to attempt to run back out. But it was too late. Erowyn clawed and scratched. The tall one screamed as blood oozed out of its open wounds. Erowyn bit into him and drank and drank until the tall wry man shriveled up. The shorter one, unfortunately, found time to run. Erowyn chased after him but could not navigate the corridors of the castle. He kept running until he found himself in the Great Hall again. This time without hesitation, he decided not to waste any of his food and began gorging himself. He kept chewing until he felt a sharp sword poking at the back of his head. He turned and saw Mr. Krynweld staring down at him. Mr. Krynweld's eyes were red. A single tear dripped down his cheek as his brows furrowed with resolution.

What followed was pandemonium. Erowyn and Mr. Krynweld danced and weaved amidst the bloody hall until they painted the columns red. Erowyn would slash at Mr. Krynweld hoping that he could find out what Mr. Krynweld tasted like on the inside, but the man would swing his swords at such a terrible speed that Erowyn would often lose a finger or two. The pain of the fingers would be replaced with a murderous itching sensation as his fingers quickly grew back. Erowyn scuttled forward at an insane pace, leapt onto a column and jumped to meet Mr. Krynweld's head. Mr. Krynweld, however, pulled up his blade to protect his head. Erowyn, in midair, realized that he would need to pivot. He would still be sliced, but if he pivoted right now, he would be able to get his fingers into Mr. Krynweld's chest.

"But why?" Erowyn though. "Mr. Krynweld never hurt me."

Erowyn shook his head and pivoted in the air, he fell slightly lower than what Mr. Krynweld was expecting and managed to grab onto Mr. Krynweld's chest and dig in. Mr. Krynweld roared. Erowyn felt his fingers rip through skin, muscle, and bone, until he couldn't feel his fingers at all. Erowyn fell as he looked at the stumps where his hands used to be. He howled as his hands grew back slowly. He looked up to see that Mr. Krynweld put away one of his swords. He circled around Mr. Krynweld as the man opened his mouth.

At first, the words didn't make sense, but Erowyn wanted to listen. He wanted to hear Mr. Krynweld. He closed his eyes and forced his brain to listen.

"-You know I wanted a kid?" Mr. Krynweld continued. Erowyn tilted his head as blood leaked from his mouth. "I really wanted to be a father. I've lost so many people in my life and I realized at some point that all I wanted was to look into my kid's eyes and teach him to be a better person than me. But this world....this world is cruel and it did cruel things to me....But now I found you, kiddo. I know you're the son of a demon and I know what've done. But I could help you. I could take care of you, kiddo."

Mr. Krynweld dropped his sword. Onto the ground. Erowyn looked at the iron sword and compared it to the spears to see that the sword was not sharpened in some time. He looked at Mr. Krynweld. The tears returned.

Erowyn got up from all fours and stood on his feet. He looked ahead, covered his face with his arms, and began walking towards Mr. Krynweld.

"I'm so sorry," he wept,"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant to-"

Erowyn felt a blade in his sternum. He felt it poking through his heart. He looked up to see Mr. Krynweld holding a silver blade piercing his chest. Erowyn gasped.

Mr. Krynweld shoved himself forward and pinned Erowyn with all his body weight. Erowyn fell back with a thud and felt the sword going through his heart till it ruptured through his back. He gurgled and gasped. He grabbed at Mr. Krynweld, but his strength had vanished. He felt scared.

"Mr. Krynwe....Mr. Krynw....please...," he pleaded. Mr. Krynweld did not budge. He stared straight into Erowyn's terrified eyes. Erowyn cried quietly. It wasn't fair.

"Mr. Krynweld.." Erowyn coughed. "You're a....a....bad person...."

Erowyn grabbed and held Mr. Krynweld as the darkness set in. He held on tightly. He didn't want to die. He was scared. He felt his fingers loosen and began silently begging Mr. Krynweld not to leave. He looked around to keep himself awake. He didn't want to die. He didn't want to die. He didn't....want....to.......
